Description: Students learning both econometrics and R may find the introduction 
    to both challenging. However, if the text is "Introductory Econometrics: 
    A Modern Approach" by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge, they are in luck! 
    The wooldridge data package aims to lighten the task by efficiently loading 
    any data set found in the text with a single command. Data sets have all been 
    compressed to a fraction of their original size and are well documented. 
    Documentation files contain the page numbers of the text where each set is used, 
    the original source, time of publication, and notes suggesting ideas for further 
    exploratory data analysis and research. If one need's to brush-up on model syntax, a 
    vignette contains R solutions to examples from each chapter of the text. 
    Data sets are from the 6th edition (Wooldridge 2016, ISBN-13: 978-1-305-27010-7), 
    and are backwards compatible with all versions of the text.
